# Phase 2 Complete - Core Infrastructure

Phase 2 of the Apicurio OpenAPI Editor project has been successfully completed!

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Zustand Stores Created

**Document Store** (`src/stores/documentStore.ts`)
- Manages OpenAPI document state
- Tracks loading state, errors, and dirty flag
- Actions: loadDocument, updateDocument, markDirty, markClean, setError, reset

**Selection Store** (`src/stores/selectionStore.ts`)
- Tracks currently selected node in the document
- Stores selected path, node, and type
- Actions: selectNode, clearSelection, setHighlight, reset

**Command Store** (`src/stores/commandStore.ts`)
- Manages command history for undo/redo
- Maintains undo and redo stacks with configurable max size (100)
- Actions: addCommand, popUndo, popRedo, canUndo, canRedo, reset

**UI Store** (`src/stores/uiStore.ts`)
- Manages UI state (modals, drawers, panels, theme)
- Actions: openModal, closeModal, toggleProblemsDrawer, toggleMasterPanel, setTheme

### 2. Service Layer Implemented

**DocumentService** (`src/services/DocumentService.ts`)
- Load and parse OpenAPI documents using `@apicurio/data-models`
- Serialize documents to JSON/object
- Validate documents and map validation problems
- Integrates with Zustand document store

**CommandService** (`src/services/CommandService.ts`)
- Execute ICommand instances on the document
- Full undo/redo support
- Command history tracking
- Integrates with both command and document stores

**SelectionService** (`src/services/SelectionService.ts`)
- Select nodes by path or direct reference
- Determine node types (path, operation, schema, etc.)
- Support for highlighting selections
- Simplified implementation (full node resolution to be added later)

**ValidationService** (`src/services/ValidationService.ts`)
- Validate OpenAPI documents
- Cache validation problems
- Filter problems by path
- Count errors, warnings, and info messages by severity

### 3. React Context and Hooks

**EditorContext** (`src/services/EditorContext.tsx`)
- React Context provider for all editor services
- Creates service instances with proper lifecycle
- Prevents prop drilling throughout component tree

**Custom Hooks**:
- `useDocument` - Access document state and operations
- `useCommand` - Execute commands, undo/redo
- `useSelection` - Manage node selection
- `useUI` - Control UI state (modals, drawers, theme)

### 4. Updated Editor Component

**OpenAPIEditor** (main component)
- Wraps content with EditorProvider
- Passes props through to OpenAPIEditorContent

**OpenAPIEditorContent** (implementation)
- PatternFly 6 layout with Masthead and Page components
- Displays document title in masthead
- Undo/redo buttons with proper enabled/disabled states
- Loads initial content on mount
- Calls onChange callback when document changes
- Shows document info (version, title, OpenAPI version)

### 5. TypeScript Models

Created comprehensive type definitions:
- `DocumentTypes.ts` - Document state and validation problems
- `SelectionTypes.ts` - Selection state and events
- `CommandTypes.ts` - Command history entries
- `UITypes.ts` - UI state and modal types

### 6. Integration with @apicurio/data-models v2.2.6

Successfully integrated with the latest data-models library:
- Using `ICommand` interface instead of `Command` class
- Using `Library.readDocument()` for parsing
- Using `Library.writeNode()` for serialization
- Using `Library.validate()` for validation
- Proper handling of `NodePath` API changes

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Zustand for State Management
- Chose Zustand over Redux/MobX for simplicity and performance
- Stores are independent but can be accessed from services
- Easy to test and reason about

### 2. Service Layer Pattern
- Services encapsulate business logic
- Services interact with Zustand stores
- React components use hooks to access services
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. Command Pattern
- All document mutations go through commands
- Enables undo/redo naturally
- Commands are serializable (important for future collaboration)
- Consistent with data-models library design

### 4. Context + Hooks
- Context provides service instances
- Hooks provide reactive state access
- Best of both worlds: dependency injection + reactivity

## Verified Functionality

✅ Project builds successfully
✅ Document can be loaded and parsed
✅ Document state is reactive
✅ Services are accessible via hooks
✅ Undo/redo UI buttons respond to state
✅ PatternFly components render correctly
✅ TypeScript strict mode passes
✅ No console errors or warnings

## What's Working

1. **Document Loading**: Can load OpenAPI documents (JSON object or string)
2. **Document Parsing**: Uses apicurio-data-models to parse into Document object
3. **State Management**: Reactive state updates via Zustand
4. **Service Access**: Services available via React Context and hooks
5. **UI Layout**: PatternFly masthead with title and toolbar
6. **Undo/Redo Buttons**: Functional (though no commands exist yet to undo)
7. **onChange Callback**: Fires when document changes

## Known Limitations / TODO

1. **Node Selection**: Simplified implementation - full NodePath resolution not yet implemented
2. **Validation**: Validation service exists but not yet integrated into UI
3. **No Forms Yet**: Phase 3 will add master/detail layout and editing forms
4. **No Commands Yet**: Need to create custom commands for editing operations

## Test Application

A test application was created in `test-app/` directory to manually test the editor component during
development.

## Next Steps - Phase 3: Basic Layout & Navigation

Phase 3 will focus on building the master/detail UI:

1. **Master/Detail Layout**: Split view with navigation tree and content panel
2. **Navigation Tree**: Display paths, schemas, responses
3. **Title Bar Enhancements**: Validation status, save/export actions
4. **Basic Search/Filter**: Filter items in navigation

**Status**: ✅ Phase 2 Complete
**Ready For**: Phase 3 - Basic Layout & Navigation
