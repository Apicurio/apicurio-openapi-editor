# Phase 4: Core Editing Features - COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

Phase 4 has been successfully completed. The core editing features have been implemented with auto-save functionality for the Main/Info form and Path metadata.

## Components Created/Updated

### 1. MainForm.tsx (Updated)
**Editing Features Added:**
- Title field is now editable with auto-save
- Version field is now editable with auto-save
- Description field is now editable with auto-save
- All changes execute ChangePropertyCommand for undo/redo support
- Updated to use proper data-models API (`getTitle()`, `getVersion()`, `getDescription()`)
- Changed note to indicate "Changes are automatically saved"

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `ChangePropertyCommand` from @apicurio/data-models
- Casts document to `OpenApi30Document` for proper typing
- Gets info object via `oaiDoc.getInfo()`
- Each field change executes a command with descriptive message
- Integrates with command service via `useCommand()` hook

### 2. PathForm.tsx (New)
**Features Implemented:**
- Displays path name in title
- Editable summary field with auto-save
- Editable description field with auto-save
- Lists all operations defined for the path
- Shows operation method (GET, POST, etc.) with badge
- Shows operation summary for each operation
- Uses ChangePropertyCommand for path metadata changes

**Implementation Details:**
- Extracts path name from selectedPath (e.g., "/paths//pets" → "/pets")
- Casts document to `OpenApi30Document`
- Gets path item via `paths.getItem(pathName)`
- Casts path item to `OpenApi30PathItem` for v3.0-specific properties
- Iterates through HTTP methods to find defined operations
- Uses proper getters: `getSummary()`, `getDescription()`
- Operations list shows method badges and summaries

### 3. DetailPanel.tsx (Updated)
- Updated to route to `PathForm` when a path is selected
- Maintains routing to `MainForm` for root/info selection
- Schema form still shows placeholder (deferred to Phase 5)

## Features Implemented

✅ **Main/Info Form Editing**
- Editable title field
- Editable version field
- Editable description field
- Auto-save on change
- Command pattern integration for undo/redo

✅ **Path Form**
- Path metadata editing (summary, description)
- Operations list display
- Auto-save on change
- Command pattern integration

✅ **Command Integration**
- All edits use ChangePropertyCommand
- Full undo/redo support
- Descriptive command messages for history

## User Experience Design Decisions

Based on user preferences from Phase 4 planning:

1. **Auto-save on change** - No Save/Cancel buttons needed, changes execute immediately
2. **Undo/Redo support** - Users can revert changes using toolbar buttons
3. **Modal dialogs** - Prepared for add operations (deferred in this phase)
4. **Path metadata focus** - Showing summary, description, and operations list

## API Usage from @apicurio/data-models

### Proper Document API Usage:
```typescript
const oaiDoc = document as OpenApi30Document;
const info = oaiDoc.getInfo();
const paths = oaiDoc.getPaths();
const pathItem = paths.getItem(pathName) as OpenApi30PathItem;
```

### Command Pattern:
```typescript
const command = new ChangePropertyCommand(node, 'propertyName', newValue);
executeCommand(command, 'Description of change');
```

### Property Getters/Setters:
- Info: `getTitle()`, `getVersion()`, `getDescription()`
- PathItem: `getSummary()`, `getDescription()`
- Operations: `getGet()`, `getPost()`, `getPut()`, etc.

## Build Status

✅ Component builds successfully (25.86 kB ESM, 16.74 kB CJS)
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ PathForm properly integrated with navigation

## Testing

The test application now supports:
- Editing API title, version, and description
- Selecting paths from navigation
- Viewing path metadata (summary, description)
- Viewing operations list for each path
- Editing path summary and description
- Undo/Redo of all changes

## Features Deferred

The following were deferred as they weren't required for Phase 4 MVP:

1. **Add Path Modal** - User can't add new paths yet (Phase 5)
2. **Delete Path** - No delete functionality yet (Phase 5)
3. **Operation Editing** - Operations are listed but not editable yet (Phase 5)
4. **Add/Delete Operations** - Can't add GET, POST, etc. yet (Phase 5)
5. **Request/Response Editing** - Not in scope for Phase 4 (Phase 6)
6. **Schema Form** - Still showing placeholder (Phase 5)

## Next Steps - Phase 5: Schema & Data Types

The next phase will implement:

1. **Schema Form Component**
   - Display schema properties
   - Edit schema metadata (title, description, type)
   - Show property list
   - Edit properties

2. **Schema CRUD Operations**
   - Add new schemas (modal dialog)
   - Delete schemas
   - Rename schemas

3. **Path/Operation CRUD**
   - Add new paths (modal dialog)
   - Delete paths
   - Add operations to paths
   - Delete operations

4. **Enhanced PathForm**
   - Click operations to edit them
   - Add/delete operations

## Files Changed in Phase 4

### Modified Files
- `src/components/forms/MainForm.tsx`
- `src/components/editor/DetailPanel.tsx`

### New Files
- `src/components/forms/PathForm.tsx`

## Code Quality

- All components use proper TypeScript types from @apicurio/data-models
- Consistent use of command pattern for all mutations
- Proper error handling for missing paths/documents
- Clear separation between path extraction and display logic
- All components have JSDoc comments
- Consistent code style with existing components
- Build size remains reasonable (under 26KB)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Data Models API Consistency**: Not all getters return MappedNodes - some (like `getSchemas()`) return plain objects
2. **Path Extraction**: Need to parse selectedPath to extract actual path names
3. **Type Casting**: Important to cast to specific version types (`OpenApi30Document`, `OpenApi30PathItem`) to get version-specific properties
4. **Operations Discovery**: Need to check all HTTP method getters to find which operations are defined
5. **Auto-save UX**: Simple and effective - no need for Save buttons when changes are immediate and undoable
