# Claude Code Instructions for This Project

## Git Workflow
- **NEVER commit changes to git unless explicitly requested by the user**
- Only stage and commit files when the user explicitly asks to commit
- The user will decide when changes are ready to be committed

## Development Workflow
- Make code changes as requested
- Let the user review the changes before committing
- Wait for explicit instruction to commit (e.g., "Please commit these changes")
